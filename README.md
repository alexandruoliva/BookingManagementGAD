# BookingManagementGAD

Application Objective:

* The objective was to create an application for small hotels and guest houses.
* The application is designed to help the administrators to organize the bookings in a better way.
* After some research I found out that there are only 3 apps on the market at this point (without synchronization).
* The initial scope of this application was to synchronize different calendars and create a centralized point for other applications like (Airbnb, Booking, etc.)

Use cases of the app:
